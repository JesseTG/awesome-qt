# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
- If you submit something that is similar to an existing entry in the list, convince me that it's better.
- Read the list before submitting a pull request, in case your idea for a contribution has already been implemented.
- Suggested software should be tested and documented.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Keep descriptions short, simple, and descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Ensure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Indent everything with four spaces.
- The pull request should have a useful title and description.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.  We also reserve the right to make edits to your PR ourselves.
