> A curated list of awesome tools, libraries, and resources for the Qt framework.

[Qt](https://www.qt.io) is a powerful cross-platform application development framework, for use primarily (but not exclusively) in C++.  It's great for GUI applications, but can be used for many other things as well.

Contributions are welcome!

## Communities

If you build it, they will come.  This section describes aggregations of Qt users who share knowledge and code with one another.  The most popular and active communities are listed in this section, but you can find a more comprehensive list [here](https://wiki.qt.io/Online_Communities) (that includes several in other languages) if you'd prefer.

### Official

### Unofficial

- [QtForum.org](http://www.qtforum.org) - Not to be confused with the official [Qt forum](https://forum.qt.io).


## Tools

A good developer writes his or her own tools.  A great one uses tools others wrote.  This section will help you be great; more formally, this section details applications that make it easier to create software with Qt.  You may also be interested in the [Libraries](#libraries) section.

### Official Tools

The Qt framework has surprisingly many tools that don't get the spotlight.  This section describes them (as well as the star players that do).  For the purpose of this section, "tool" refers to Qt-centric utilities whose code does *not* get embedded within your application (but their output might).

- [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qtproject/qt-creator) - By no means does Qt lock you into its provided IDE, but its firm integration with the framework makes it a good sell.  Among other things, it provides a UI designer, modeling tools, a documentation browser, and great QML support if you're into that sort of thing.  There's also a plugin system, but third-party plugins are unfortunately scarce.
  - [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/designer) - If you'd rather just design the interfaces and let someone else hook them up to logic, the GUI designer is available as a separate application.
  - [Qt Assistant](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtassistant-index.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/assistant) - So is the documentation viewer, for that matter.
- [Qt Visual Studio Add-in](https://doc.qt.io/archives/vs-addin) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt-labs/vstools) - If you'd rather stick to Visual Studio, this add-in will let you do that.
- [Qt Linguist](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/linguist) - Qt provides excellent internationalization/localization support, and this tool is very much responsible for it.  Write translatable strings in your code with special macros, and this tool will aggregate them all for you so you or your translator(s) can broaden your software's audience.
- [Qt Installer Framework](https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qtproject/installer-framework) - Nobody seems to talk about this, but Qt also provides a way to write an installer for your application.  Does not support creation of macOS disk images, app bundles, or Linux packages, so be mindful of that when considering your project's distribution.
  - [`macdeployqt`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/osx-deployment.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/macdeployqt) - Generates macOS application bundles for Qt projects.
- [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qtbase/tree/dev/qmake) - The bundled build system designed for Qt, though it can be used for non-Qt projects.
- [qbs](https://doc.qt.io/qbs) [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt-labs/qbs) - If QML is more your style, consider this alternative build system.
- [Emulator](https://doc.qt.io/emulator) - Don't forget about Qt's mobile support!
- `qtdiag` [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/qtdiag) - Command-line tool that prints out a lot of information pertaining to both your Qt installation and your system in general.  No link because there's no dedicated web page; just run `qtdiag` on the command line.  Excellent for troubleshooting.
- `qmleasing` [:octocat:](https://github.com/qt/qtdeclarative/tree/dev/tools/qmleasing) - Lets you make easing curves suitable for QML, though if you understand the underlying math there's no reason you couldn't use the resulting numbers elsewhere.

### Third-Party Tools

- [CMake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-manual.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) - General C++ build tool that happens to have great Qt support.
- [GammaRay](https://www.kdab.com/development-resources/qt-tools/gammaray) [:octocat:](https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay) - Powerful debugger and general inspection tool for Qt-built software.  Lets you inspect and manipulate the `QObject` hierarchy, view object properties, edit widgets at runtime, and far, *far* more.  A two-sentence blurb can't do it justice, seriously check it out.
- [moc-ng](https://github.com/woboq/moc-ng) [:octocat:](https://github.com/woboq/moc-ng) - Alternative implementation of `moc` that's binary-compatible with Qt's version.
- [Qt-Inspector](https://github.com/robertknight/Qt-Inspector) [:octocat:](https://github.com/robertknight/Qt-Inspector) - Inspection tool with similar goals to GammaRay, though much simpler.
- [SIP](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip) [:package:](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/hg/sip) - Generates Python bindings for C or C++ libraries.  Has special support for Qt signals and slots, and was used to create [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt).
- [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt) [:octocat:](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt) - Lets you bundle your Qt based application as an AppDir or [AppImage](http://appimage.org), making it possible to ship it to users of many desktop Linux distributions. Similar to the official `windeployqt` and `macdeployqt` tools but for Linux.

## Bindings in Other Languages

This section describes software that enables creation of Qt software in a primary language other than C++.  Libraries that allow run-time scripting in a Qt application are listed under [Integrations](#integrations).

- [Python (via PyQt)](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) [:package:](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) - Arguably the most comprehensive and well-known binding of Qt to another language.
- [Python (via PySide)](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide) [:package:](https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside.git) - Another binding for Python, which has been officially adopted by the Qt project.
- [Ring (via RingQt)](http://ring-lang.sourceforge.net/doc/qt.html) [:octocat:](https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringqt) - I've never heard of this language either, honestly.
- [Mono/.NET languages (via QtSharp)](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp) [:octocat:](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp) - Experimental wrapper for Qt that allows it to be used by .NET-based languages such as C#.  Young, but active.

See these [these](https://www.ics.com/blog/using-qt-alternative-programming-languages-part-1) [three](https://www.ics.com/blog/using-qt-alternative-programming-languages-part-2) [articles](https://wiki.qt.io/Category:LanguageBindings) if you want more.

## Libraries

This section describes two kinds of third-party libraries; those that provide their own brand-new functionality (e.g. widgets, dealing with particular file formats), and those that provide integrations with existing software (e.g. scripting languages, clients for REST APIs, implementations of established protocols).


### Integrations

For the purpose of this section, an "Integration"-focused library does one of the following:

1. Serves as a client for an established Web service.
2. Wraps another library in a Qt-friendly manner as more than just an implementation detail (i.e. it tries to mimic the wrapped API).

- [Awesome C/C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) - There's no reason you can't use C++ libraries that weren't designed for Qt.  Sometimes they might even suit your needs better than what Qt offers.
- [Awesome C](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c) - Same goes for C libraries; might wanna brush up on those RAII techniques while you're at it.
- [Awesome CMake](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake) - If you're not using qmake for your project, you're likely using CMake instead.
